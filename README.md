Overall description:

An attendance management system is a software application that helps organizations keep track of employee attendance, working hours, and absences. The system can be used to monitor attendance and absenteeism, calculate employee salaries, and generate reports on attendance patterns and trends.

The system typically uses a combination of biometric devices, such as fingerprint or facial recognition scanners, and software to record employee attendance. Some systems also allow employees to log in remotely using mobile apps or web portals.

The main benefits of an attendance management system include improved accuracy in tracking employee attendance and working hours, increased efficiency in managing employee time and attendance records, and reduced administrative burden on HR personnel.
Database:
An attendance management system typically includes a database that stores employee attendance and working hour data. The database may be a relational database management system (RDBMS) or a NoSQL database, depending on the specific requirements of the system.
